Improvement to 1-D literals by Brian Dickens:
http://hostilefork.com/2009/08/29/tweakinganalog-literals-humor/

I'm working on a rewrite with the following goals:
  - represent line<3> as o---o, not o-------o
  - otherwise match Eelis's excellent style and exported API
  - allow both "*" and "o" for corners/endpoints, as far as possible
  - allow both "-" and "~" for horizontals, as far as possible
  - allow both "!" and "|" for verticals, as far as possible
  - allow cuboids of all dimensions, such as cuboid<1,2,1>
  - end-to-end-test all features
